This is a mini-project for a competition in AI_CLUB (UIT - University Of Information Technology, Vietnam)

In this project, I'll show you how to train your custom data by using YOLO. By the way, I am using polygon format (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) and I need convert it into YOLO Format (xcenter, ycenter, width, height)
Please check YOLO_Convert.py

1. Create YAML File
2. Split your custom data to train val test
3. Install Ultralytics
4. Train and eval = main.py
